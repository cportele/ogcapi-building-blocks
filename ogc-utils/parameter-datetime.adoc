= Parameter: datetime

Version: 1.0.1

== Overview

The `datetime` query parameter provides a simple mechanism for filtering resources based on their temporal extent. It selects all resources that intersect an temporal instant or interval.

== Description

`datetime` is a query parameter that may be applied in GET requests on a collection of resources.

The parameter, if provided, selects the resources with a temporal extent that intersects the specified temporal link:../schemas/instant.adoc[instant] or link:../schemas/interval.adoc[interval]. 

The `datetime` parameter matches all resources in the collection that are not associated with a temporal extent, too.

All instants in the `datetime` parameter have to be timestamps with a timezone.

For intervals, the text representation is used. The interval notation is taken from ISO 8601-2:2019. ISO 8601-2 distinguishes open start/end timestamps (double-dot) and unknown start/end timestamps (empty string). For queries, an unknown start/end has the same effect as an open start/end.

"Intersects" means that the time (instant or interval) specified in the parameter `datetime` includes a timestamp that is part of the temporal geometry of the resource (again, a time instant or interval). For time intervals this includes the start and end time.

If a resource has multiple temporal geometry properties, it is the decision of the server whether only a single temporal geometry property is used to determine the temporal extent or all relevant geometries.
