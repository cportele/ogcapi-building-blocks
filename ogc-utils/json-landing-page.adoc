= Resource: OGC API Landing Page

Version: 1.0.1

== Description

The OGC API Landing Page provides links to important resources in the API, as a JSON object. All other OGC API resources are sub-resources of this resource.

The landing page will typically also include essential metadata about the API, for example, a title and a description.

== Pre-defined properties

.Properties
[cols="20,10a,70a",options="header"]
!===
|Property |Type |Description
|title |string |The name of the API.
|description |string |A free-text description of the API. The content may include Markdown and HTML markup.

== Link relation types

The following link relation types are commonly used in links from an OGC Collection:

.Outgoing link relation types
[cols="25,75a",options="header"]
!===
|Link relation type |Description
|`service-desc` |**REQUIRED**. Identifies a service description for the API that is primarily intended for consumption by machines. Typically an OpenAPI definition.
|`service-doc` |**REQUIRED**.  Identifies a service documentation for the API that is primarily intended for human consumption. Typically HTML pages derived from an OpenAPI definition.
|`conformance` |**REQUIRED**. Refers to a link:conformance-declaration.adoc[conformance declaration] resource that identifies the specifications that the API conforms to.

This link relation type will not be registered with IANA. It will in the future be superseded by the `\http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/conformance` link relation type.
|`\http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/conformance` |**RECOMMENDED**. Refers to a link:conformance-declaration.adoc[conformance declaration] resource that identifies the specifications that the API conforms to. 

This link relation type will in the future supersede the `conformance` link relation type, so it is recommended to already include this link.
|`data` |**CONDITIONAL**. Refers to a link:../../../geo/common/resources/collections.adoc[OGC Collections] resource that represents the root resource of the distributions of a dataset.

This link relation type will not be registered with IANA. It will in the future be superseded by the `\http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/data` link relation type.
|`\http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/data` |Refers to a link:../../../geo/common/resources/collections.adoc[OGC Collections] resource that represents the root resource of the distributions of a dataset.

This link relation type will in the future supersede the `data` link relation type, so it is recommended to already include this link.
|`self` |**STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**. Link to the resource in the current representation.
|`alternate` |**STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**. Link to the resource in every other media type supported by the server.
!===

The following link relation types may be useful in links to an OGC API Landing Page:

.Incoming link relation types
[cols="25,75a",options="header"]
!===
|Link relation type |Description
|`home` |From sub-resources or external resources.

The link relation type is not yet registered with IANA. It is proposed in an Internet Draft https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-06[Home Documents for HTTP APIs].
